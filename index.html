         <h1>Kiara Baxter</h1>
         <p class="bio"> My name is Kiara Baxter, and I am a sophomore double majoring in Creative Writing and Professional and Technical Writing. I am originally from Doylestown Pennsylvania, but I moved to Chesapeake Virginia when I was 10. So, I call both my home. Something I love about my life at the moment is my new kitten, Luna. I adopted her a few months ago and it has been amazing becoming a cat mom! My guilty pleasure is reality tv. I love reality tv, I would spend all day everyday watching it if I could. My favorites right now are Jersey Shore and The Beverly Hills Housewives. I'm also a tv-show binger, so there's that too.

          <p class="description">
            This post will discuss social media and how it is used today. It also discusses the good side of social media, which is not usually discussed in society today. Hopefully readers will learn a thing or two from the <a href="https://medium.com/@kiaramb/the-good-side-of-social-media-8da6044299a4">blogpost</a> and create their own ideas about social media.

          <h2>Possible Social Media Standards for Guys and Girls</h2>
          <p class="description">
            This podcast questions the gender divides between men and women in social media. Both genders approach social media differently. This audio is talking about the possible different social media standards for men and women. We invited several students from Virginia Tech, and they were interviewed about this topic. Enjoy the group <a href="https://soundcloud.com/yuqin-feng/possible-different-social-media-standards-for-guys-and-girls?utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing">podcast</a>.
