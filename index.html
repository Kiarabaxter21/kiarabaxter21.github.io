         <h1>Kiara Baxter</h1>
         <p class="bio"> My name is Kiara Baxter and I am a sophomore double majoring in Creative Writing and Professional and Technical Writing. I am originally from Doylestown Pennsylvania, but I moved to Chesapeake Virginia when I was 10. So I call both my home. Something I love about my life at the moment is my new kitten Luna  (she is my profile picture). I adopted her a few months ago and it has been amazing becoming a cat mom! My guilty pleasure is reality tv. I love reality tv, I would spend all day everyday watching it if I could. My favorites right now are Jersey Shore and The Beverly Hills Housewives. I'm also a tv-show binger, so there's that too.

            This post will discuss how exactly you can write your own code, even if you have never looked at code before in your life. Code can be hard, don't get me wrong, but with simple instructions almost anyone can do it!</p>

            This podcast questions the gender divide between men and women in social media. Both genders approach social media differently. This audio is talking about the possible different social media standards for men and women. We invited several students from Virginia Tech, and they were interviewed about this topic.
